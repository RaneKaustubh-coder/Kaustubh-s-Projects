The Python GUI Calculator

This project is a simple, interactive calculator application, brought to life using **Python** and its **built-in Tkinter library**. 
It's designed to handle all your **basic arithmetic** needs—**addition**, **subtraction**, **multiplication**, and **division**—all within a straightforward **graphical interface**.

What I have learned:

Building this calculator was a fantastic practical exercise that helped me grasp **core concepts in GUI development** and **Python programming**.

1. GUI Fundamentals: I learned how to construct a **user-friendly visual interface** from scratch.

2. Layout Management: Learning Tkinter's **grid system** was key to making the buttons and display adjust nicely when you resize the window.

3. Event Handling: Connecting **button clicks** to specific **actions**, like **adding** a number to the display or **calculating a result**, was a major focus.

4. User Interaction: Handling **diverse user inputs** (numbers, operators) and ensuring the display always shows the correct output.

5. Basic Error Handling: Including safeguards to gracefully **manage unexpected inputs** and **prevent crashes**.

6. This project is a clear example of applying fundamental programming logic to create a functional and interactive tool. **Give it a try!**
