Project Title: Command-Line To-Do List Application

Description:
This is a robust command-line interface (CLI) application designed for efficient task management. Developed using Python for the application logic and MySQL as the backend database, it provides users with a comprehensive set of functionalities to manage their daily tasks.

Key Features:
1. Create (Add Tasks): Users can easily add new tasks to their To-Do list, providing a description for each.
2. Read (View Tasks): Displays all existing tasks, showing their unique ID, description, and current completion status.
3. Update (Mark Tasks): Allows users to update the status of any task (mark as completed or incomplete) by referencing its unique ID.
4. Delete (Remove Tasks): Provides the ability to permanently remove tasks from the list using their unique ID.

Technologies Used:
1. Python: Core programming language for application logic and user interaction.
2. MySQL: Relational database management system used for persistent storage of tasks. 
3. mysql.connector: Python library facilitating seamless connection and interaction with the MySQL database.

What this project demonstrates:
1. Practical experience with database integration in Python applications.
2. Implementation of full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
3. Skills in SQL query construction and execution.
4. Development of an interactive Command-Line Interface (CLI).
5. Robust error handling for database operations and user input.

How to Use This Description:
