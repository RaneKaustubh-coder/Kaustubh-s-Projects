This project is a classic Number **Guessing Game** built purely with Python. 
It's a fun, interactive console application designed to test your intuition against a randomly chosen number. 
Can you guess it before your chances run out?

How to Play (and What You'll Find Inside)
The game is straightforward and offers a little challenge:

Choose Your Difficulty: Pick from **Easy, Normal, or Hard modes,** each setting a **different range** for the secret number.
Limited Chances: You'll get a **fixed number of attempts** to pinpoint the hidden number.
Helpful Hints: After each guess, the game tells you if you've gone **"too low" or "too high**," guiding you closer to the target.
**Play Again!** Finished a round? You'll have the option to dive straight back into another game.
Behind the Scenes (**What I Learned**)
Developing this game was a fantastic way to solidify some fundamental Python concepts:

Core Logic: Implementing conditional statements (**if/elif/else**) to guide the game flow.
Looping & Iteration: Managing game rounds and user guesses with **while loops**.
Randomness: Using Python's **random module** to generate unpredictable numbers.
User Input & Interaction: Handling **input** from the player and providing clear feedback.
Robustness: Implementing **try-except blocks **to handle **potential user input errors** (like typing text instead of a number!).

This project is a great example of building an interactive application from scratch, focusing on clear logic and a smooth user experience. **Give it a shot!**
