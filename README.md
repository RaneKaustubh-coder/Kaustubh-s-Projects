# Kaustubh's Projects

This Repository shows my personal coding projects, demonstrating my skills and practical application of programming concepts.
About This Repository:
This repository is dedicated to my coding projects. Here, you'll find a variety of applications and solutions built with **PYTHON**

Projects Included (so far!):
1. Simple Calculator:[ https://github.com/RaneKaustubh-coder/Kaustubh-s-Projects/blob/main/Simple%20Calculator.py](https://github.com/RaneKaustubh-coder/Kaustubh-s-Projects/tree/main/Simple%20Calculator)

Description: A basic interactive calculator application with arithmetic operations and responsive GUI design.

Technologies: Python, Tkinter.

Key Learnings: GUI layout management (grid), event handling (lambda functions), basic error handling (try-except), and user input processing.

2. To_Do_List: [https://github.com/RaneKaustubh-coder/Kaustubh-s-Projects/tree/main/To_Do_List](https://github.com/RaneKaustubh-coder/Kaustubh-s-Projects/tree/main/To_Do_List)

Description: This project is an interactive command-line interface (CLI) application for managing personal tasks. It leverages Python for the application logic and MySQL for persistent data storage, providing a robust solution for task organization.

Technologies: Python, MySQL

Key Learnings:
1. Database Integration: Practical experience connecting Python applications to a relational database.
2. CRUD Operations: Full implementation of Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionalities for task records.
3. SQL Query Construction: Skill in writing and executing essential SQL commands (INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE).
4. Command-Line Interface (CLI): Development of an interactive menu-driven user interface.
5. Error Handling: Incorporating robust try-except blocks for database operations and user input validation.
